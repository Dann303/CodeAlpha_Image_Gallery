# CodeAlpha_Image_Gallery
Source code for the first task in the internship provided by CodeAlpha. The task was to create an image gallery where users can view a collection of images. I was instructed to only use HTML/CSS for layout and JavaScript for image navigation and any interactive features. Everything was written from scratch without the use of any predefined classes.
